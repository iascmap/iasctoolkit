#### What are cookies?

A cookie is simply a technology for remembering something about you. They are small text files which are transferred to your computer or mobile when you visit a website or app. [Learn more.](https://www.cookiesandyou.com/)


#### What cookies do we use?

**Functional cookie**<br/>
We use a functional cookie ("cookiesOK") to indicate if you agree to our use of cookies.

**Google Analytics**<br/>
If you consent, we use the Google Analytics service to help us to improve our website by collecting and reporting information on how you use it.<br/>
In order to track your session usage, Google uses two cookies ("_ga" ) with a randomly-generated ClientID in your browser. This ID is anonymized and contains no identifiable information like email, phone number, name, etc. We also send Google your IP Address to derive coarse geo-location data (like city, country, etc). We use Google Analytics to track aggregated website behaviour, such as what pages you looked at, for how long, and so on.


#### Controlling cookies

- [Learn how to control and disable the cookies you donâ€™t want.](https://www.cookiesandyou.com/)
- Install the [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881) to prevent Google Analytics that is running on websites from sharing information with Google Analytics about visit activity.
