The Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking  Guide for the UK Aviation Industry was launched on behalf of the  UK Modern Slavery Training Delivery Group in partnership with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) at  Cardiff Airport on Thursday 29th November 2018.  It recognises the need for the 350,000 people directly employed in UK aviation to understand the potential signs of modern slavery and human trafficking and how to report suspected cases.

Within the guidance, IATA have also provided a link for teams to access free on- line training and a video.  This can be found on page 18.
