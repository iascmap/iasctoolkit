## The hospitality and tourism industry can be vulnerable to modern slavery.

Hotels and other types of accommodation are sometimes used by traffickers as venues for forced prostitution and child sexual exploitation. The nature of the hospitality industry workforce, with its relatively high proportion of agency, seasonal and migrant labour, means that it can also targeted by organised criminals practicing labour exploitation.  These resources provide a basic training package and associated materials to help hoteliers understand the risks and signs of exploitation, and to communicate these to their staff.
