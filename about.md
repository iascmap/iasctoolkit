# About this site

In 2017 research from the University of Nottingham and Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner demonstrated that although multi-agency anti-slavery partnership work was developing across the UK, it lacked consistency and resources.  In addition, very little monitoring and evaluation of partnership activity was occurring, and it was unclear what constituted ‘good’ practice.

This toolkit is an attempt to help fill that gap, by providing a checklist to assist in reviewing partnership activity, a governance library to improve accountability and performance, access to the UK Training Library, plus a range of information, web-links and case studies to assist with other important aspects of anti-slavery activity.

We are grateful to all who have given permission for their resources to be shared on this site.  If you have resources that you would like to contribute, please contact us at <a href="mailto:rightslab@nottingham.ac.uk">rightslab@nottingham.ac.uk</a>.
