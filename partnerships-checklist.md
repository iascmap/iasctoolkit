<div class="checklist">			
<h2>Function</h2>
<ol class="toolkit">
<li>What would you like your partnership to do?
<ul>
<li>Provide strategic co-ordination for anti-slavery work in your area?</li>
<li>Provide operational coordination for anti-slavery work in your area?</li>
<li>Share information and resources?</li>
<li>Increase understanding of the nature and scale of modern slavery in your area?</li>

</ul>
<div>These different functions involve different types of partners and methods of engagement. See our <a href="/governance-library/">governance</a> page for examples of different types of multi-agency partnership.</div>
<div>For a partnership to function effectively and understand its priorities, it needs to have a clear idea of what the threat looks like in the local area. For example, Serious and Organised Crime Partnerships are encouraged to produce a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/serious-and-organised-crime-local-profiles">Serious and Organised Crime local profile</a>.</div>
