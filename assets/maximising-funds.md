## Funding is an important consideration in anti-slavery partnership working. Securing funding empowers partners to achieve their vision.

According to a recent survey of funding sources for anti-slavery partnerships (see [Collaborating for Freedom report 2017](http://iascmap.nottingham.ac.uk/CollaboratingforFreedom.pdf)), most partnerships were funding work through the mainstream budgets of key partners and in-kind contributions, with very little dedicated funding. In some cases the local Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (OPCC) was providing funding.  For instance, Hampshire OPCC has used Police funding to support the Modern Slavery Partnership for the last four years. This initially funded the work of the Medaille Trust and more recently has funded a coordinator. In addition the Hampshire OPCC funds the Hampshire Trafficking Service for young people over 18.

UK Government funding often comes in the form of dedicated grants aimed at specific subjects and there are sometimes limited timescales and strict guidelines for accessing funding. By using existing relationships with partner agencies and contacts across local networks, you can increase the chances of capitalising on funding opportunities when they arise.

This page has some examples of funding sources.
