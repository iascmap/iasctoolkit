## Performance management can help anti-slavery partnerships to ask and answer important questions about their vision and objectives.

In some areas, like the West Midlands, anti-slavery work is clearly linked to joint planning frameworks, for instance the Liberate plan which includes targeted actions and milestones that partner agencies own collectively. Other areas have different systems in place to monitor activities against objectives.

Performance management is essential to demonstrate the effectiveness of anti-slavery partnership working. This page has some examples showing how anti-slavery partnerships have established performance management. It also includes a short guide to performance management for anti-slavery partnerships.
