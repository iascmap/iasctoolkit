## Modern slavery statements show the commitment of organisations to tackle areas of risk within their business.

Anti-slavery partnerships can encourage member organisations to develop a modern slavery transparency statement as part of their commitment to identify and combat modern slavery in their organisations, supply chains, and the wider community.

Modern slavery transparency statements vary in detail. Although they are not yet a statutory requirement, some councils have developed modern slavery transparency statements as part of their commitment to anti-slavery partnership.  This page includes some examples from councils as well as a business, John Lewis Partnership plc. showing how it works in partnership with other agencies to prevent and tackle modern slavery.

There are also links to two independent repositories which hold modern slavery statements in the UK.
