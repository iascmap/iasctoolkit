## Reviewing procurement practice is an important aspect of demonstrating your organisational commitment to tackling potential exploitation in supply chains.

The Wales guidelines on ethical procurement set a framework for good procurement practice which can be adopted by any organisation.  See also the guidance on protecting human rights in the supply chain from London Universities Purchasing Consortium, University of Greenwich and the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply.

The London Universities Purchasing Consortium also have an e-learning package for procurement professionals.  Donâ€™t forget to examine labour supply: The University of Nottingham have carried out a pilot study into the risk of slavery in social care.
