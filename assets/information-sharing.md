## Information sharing brings multiple benefits.

Information sharing protocols or agreements provide a framework for the secure and confidential collation, holding, recording, storing and sharing of information between participating partner agencies or organisations. In Nottinghamshire, along with information sharing agreements between partner agencies a cloud-based platform, ECINS, has been used to share information for multi-agency disruption of hand car washes. A case study of ECINS is provided on this page.

This page also includes Derbyshireâ€™s modern slavery multi-agency tactical response information sharing agreement, as well as a Home Office report on setting up multi-agency information sharing models.
