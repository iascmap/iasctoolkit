## Clear lines of accountability are helpful in ensuring goals are met, and in connecting anti-slavery partnerships to other relevant work in the region.

In some areas, like Derbyshire, anti-slavery work is linked to the local community safety partnership, with support coming from the adults and childrenâ€™s safeguarding boards.  In the West Midlands, anti-slavery work is overseen at a senior level by key public services through the Preventing Violence against Vulnerable People (PVVP) Programme Board as well as local partnership structures. This page has some examples showing how anti-slavery partnerships have linked into wider governance structures.
