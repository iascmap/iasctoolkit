## The identification of a victim is the first step in what can be a lengthy recovery process.

If you have concerns that someone is experiencing exploitation, there are a number of agencies who can assist.

- In cases where there is immediate danger call **999** and ask for the Police.
- If you would like to speak to the Police but the issue is non-urgent, call **101**.
- Advice and assistance can also be gained from the [Modern Slavery Helpline](https://www.modernslaveryhelpline.org/) **08000 121 700**, and/or [Salvation Army helpline](https://www.salvationarmy.org.uk/referring-victims) **0800 808 3733**.

Potential victims of modern slavery are entitled to support and protection from the UK Government. To access this support victims must be referred to the [National Referral Mechanism (NRM)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-report-modern-slavery/how-to-report-modern-slavery).

It is essential that all victims are provided access to high-quality care and the support to rebuild their lives. The following resources have been developed by partnerships and sector experts to help direct practitioners and survivors to appropriate support.

[**Mapping of Trafficking Survivor Services**](https://www.humantraffickingfoundation.org/support-services): this resource produced by the Human Trafficking Foundation, IASC and ATLEU shows support services for survivors in the UK.

**Victim care pathways**: As a partnership, you may wish to develop guidance on the identification, referral and support of potential victims encountered in your area. The following links are examples of victim care partnerships which have been developed by existing partnerships.

**Legal support**: Victims of modern slavery may require a range of legal support, from advice on immigration and housing, to compensation. The links below will direct you to useful legal resources.
