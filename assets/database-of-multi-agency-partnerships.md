## Mapping locations and activities for anti-slavery partnerships across the UK.

In 2017 the Rights Lab at the University of Nottingham, in collaboration with the Office of the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, undertook research to identify the number, size and make-up of anti-slavery partnerships in existence across the UK. The findings of the research were documented in the report ‘[**Collaborating for freedom: anti-slavery partnerships in the UK**](https://iascmap.nottingham.ac.uk/CollaboratingforFreedom.pdf)’ and visually displayed through an interactive map showing the location and membership of the various partnerships across the UK. A link to this map and the corresponding database of anti-slavery partnerships can be viewed through the following link.
