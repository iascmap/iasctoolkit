## To maximise the reach and impact of your partnership, you will need to consider how to involve and engage the various members of your community, such as business partners, local and national NGOs, and faith groups.

You may wish to engage with particular individuals and groups for specific pieces of work, or want to collaborate with others on a more regular basis. The below links provide examples of where partnerships have successfully collaborated with businesses, NGOs and faith groups.

**Business engagement**: The private sector has a key role in ending modern slavery. You can support businesses to detect, address and deter exploitation in their business and supply chain. Businesses in turn may be able to support the work of the partnership by, for instance, undertaking awareness raising activities or by donating funding. Below are examples of businesses engaging with the work of partnerships.

**Community engagement**: Many members of the public are shocked by the revelation that slavery continues to exist.  It is important that communities are aware of risks and know how to report any concerns.  Community awareness raising can also be targeted at demand factors such as purchasing habits.

**Faith engagement**: It may be useful to consider the range of religious denominations practicing in your local area or region. Faith groups often work with the most vulnerable individuals in the community, and places of worship can serve as community hubs. As such, faith groups can be helpful in raising awareness of modern slavery, can potentially identify victims within the community, and may be able to help generate funds for your partnership work. The following are examples where partnerships have engaged faith groups in their work.
