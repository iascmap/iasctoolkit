## Three pieces of legislation introduced in 2015 form the pillars of the UK’s statutory framework for tackling modern slavery.

The Modern Slavery Act, the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Criminal Justice and Support for Victims) Act (Northern Ireland) and the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Scotland) Act.

In addition to these, this page houses related pieces of legislation which impact on the treatment of modern slavery victims, and which underpin the response by relevant authorities.
