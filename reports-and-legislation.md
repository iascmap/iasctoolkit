In 2015, the Modern Slavery Act, the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Criminal Justice and Support for Victims) Act (Northern Ireland) and the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Scotland) Act came into force. This legislation provides a statutory framework for the UK’s response to human trafficking and modern slavery. 

Complementing this legislation is a wide range of policy and guidance, for the multiple professions who are impacted through it. The links also direct you to recent research, which provides useful analysis on the UK’s response to modern slavery.
